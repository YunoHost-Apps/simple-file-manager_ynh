## Overview

A Simple PHP file manager. The code is a single php file.  

### Features

- Single file, there are no images, or css folders.  
- Ajax based so it is fast, but doesn't break the back button
- Allows drag and drop file uploads if the folder is writable by the webserver (`chmod 777 your/folder`)
- Suits my aesthetics.  More like Dropbox, and less like Windows Explorer
- Works with Unicode file names
- The interface is usable from an iPad
- XSRF protection, and an optional password.

**Shipped version:** 1.0~ynh1
